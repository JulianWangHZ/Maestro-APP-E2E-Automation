- Access to GoGoX app builds (Android APK/iOS IPA) or physical device with the app installed

### Installing Maestro

Run the following command to install Maestro on macOS, Linux or Windows (WSL):

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash
```

If you're on macOS, you can use Homebrew instead of the install script above:

```bash
brew tap mobile-dev-inc/tap
brew install maestro
```

üí° **Using Windows?** Follow this guide to get set up on a Windows machine: [Installing Maestro on Windows](https://docs.maestro.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro)

## üîß Configuration

### App Configuration

The main test flow is defined in `maestro/transport_flow_non_login.yaml`:

```yaml
appId: hk.gogovan.GoGoVanClient2
---
# Step 1: Launch the app
- killApp
- clearState
- launchApp

# Step 2: Tap on the Transport Service
- tapOn: "home__top_sheet__service__medal__gogovan"

# Step 3: Tap on unavailable address window
- tapOn:
    id: "hk.gogovan.GoGoVanClient2:id/primaryButton"

# Step 4: Input pickup and delivery addresses
- tapOn: "‰∏äË≤®Èªû"
- inputText: "35 Hung To Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon"
- tapOn: "route_item_1"
- tapOn: "ÂÆåÊàê"
- tapOn: "ËêΩË≤®Èªû"
- inputText: "38 Hung To Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon"
- tapOn: "route_item_1"
- tapOn: "ÂÆåÊàê"
- tapOn: "‰∏ã‰∏ÄÊ≠•"

# And many more steps...
```

This test flow:
- Tests the complete non-login transport booking flow
- Covers address input, time selection, vehicle type, and add-on services
- Validates the redirect to login page at the end

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running Tests

For local development and testing:

```bash
# Run the transport flow test
maestro test maestro/transport_flow_non_login.yaml

# Run all flows in the maestro directory
maestro test maestro/

# Run with verbose output for debugging
maestro test --verbose maestro/transport_flow_non_login.yaml
```

## üéØ Maestro Studio

Maestro Studio is a powerful interactive tool that helps you create and debug test flows visually. It provides a real-time view of your app's UI hierarchy and allows you to interact with elements directly.

![Maestro Studio Interface](assets/maestro_studio.png)

### Starting Maestro Studio

```bash
# Launch Maestro Studio
maestro studio
```

This will open a web interface in your browser where you can:

### Key Features

1. **Visual Element Inspection**
   - View the complete UI hierarchy of your app
   - Inspect element properties (id, text, accessibility labels)
   - See element bounds and positioning

2. **Interactive Testing**
   - Click on elements directly in the browser
   - Test interactions without writing YAML first
   - Generate test steps automatically

3. **Real-time Flow Creation**
   - Record your interactions as you perform them
   - Export recorded flows to YAML format
   - Edit and refine flows in real-time

4. **Debugging Support**
   - Step through existing flows
   - Identify why elements aren't being found
   - Validate selectors and assertions

### Using Maestro Studio Workflow

1. **Connect your device** and launch the app
2. **Start Maestro Studio**: `maestro studio`
3. **Inspect elements** by hovering over them in the browser
4. **Record interactions** by clicking the record button
5. **Export your flow** to a YAML file
6. **Refine and test** your generated flow

### Example Studio Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start studio
maestro studio

# 2. In the browser interface:
#    - Navigate through your app
#    - Click on elements to inspect them
#    - Record your test scenario
#    - Export as YAML

# 3. Save the generated flow
# 4. Test the flow
maestro test your-generated-flow.yaml
```

### Pro Tips for Studio Usage

- **Use Studio for element discovery**: When elements are hard to find, Studio shows all available selectors
- **Record complex gestures**: Studio can capture swipes, scrolls, and multi-touch interactions
- **Validate flows**: Use Studio to step through existing flows and debug issues
- **Generate base flows**: Create initial flows quickly, then refine them manually

## üìù Writing Test Flows

### Test Flow Example

The `transport_flow_non_login.yaml` demonstrates a comprehensive E2E test that includes:

**Complete Flow Steps:**
1. **App Initialization**: Kill, clear state, and launch app
2. **Service Selection**: Select transport service
3. **Address Input**: Enter pickup (‰∏äË≤®Èªû) and delivery (ËêΩË≤®Èªû) addresses
4. **Time Selection**: Choose pickup time with swipe gestures
5. **Charging Method**: Select hourly rental option
6. **Vehicle Selection**: Choose vehicle type (Premium Van)
7. **Add-on Services**: 
   - Add passengers
   - Rent a cart
   - Select goods specifications (longer than 6ft, taller than 2ft)
   - Pet-friendly driver
   - English-speaking driver
   - Tunnel preference (Á¥ÖÁ£°Êµ∑Â∫ïÈößÈÅì)
   - Door-to-door moving service
   - Waste disposal service
8. **Contact Information**: Input name and phone number
9. **Driver Notes**: Add special instructions
10. **Order Review**: Verify pricing and place order
11. **Validation**: Assert redirect to login page

### Basic Flow Structure

```yaml
appId: hk.gogovan.GoGoVanClient2
---
- launchApp
- tapOn: "service_button"
- inputText: "35 Hung To Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon"
- tapOn: "route_item_1"
- assertVisible: "ÂÆåÊàê"
```



## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **App not launching**: Verify the `appId` matches your app's bundle identifier
2. **Elements not found**: Use Maestro Studio to inspect UI elements and find correct selectors
3. **Timeouts**: Increase wait times for slow-loading screens
4. **Device connection**: Ensure your device is properly connected and recognized
5. **Flow execution fails**: Use Maestro Studio to step through flows and identify issues

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# View device hierarchy
maestro hierarchy

# Launch Maestro Studio for visual debugging
maestro studio

# Record a flow interactively
maestro record

# Run with detailed output
maestro test --verbose maestro/launch.yaml

# Test a specific flow with Studio integration
maestro studio --flow maestro/launch.yaml
```

### Using Maestro Studio for Debugging

When your tests fail, Maestro Studio is invaluable for debugging:

1. **Element Not Found Errors**:
   ```bash
   maestro studio
   # Use the visual inspector to find the correct element selector
   ```

2. **Flow Step Validation**:
   ```bash
   maestro studio --flow maestro/your-flow.yaml
   # Step through each action to see where it fails
   ```

3. **UI Hierarchy Inspection**:
   - Launch Studio and navigate to the problematic screen
   - Inspect the element tree to understand the UI structure
   - Copy the correct selector from Studio to your YAML file
